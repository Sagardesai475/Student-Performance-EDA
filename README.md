This project is a thorough analysis of student performance based on factors such as lunch types and gender. Using Pythonâ€™s pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries, the analysis covers data cleaning, visualization, and insight extraction.

Key analyses include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring raw data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical summaries, histograms, and box plots.
Comparative Analysis: Score comparisons based on lunch types and gender.
Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps and correlation matrices to understand variable relationships.
Visualizations: A wide range of charts to present findings clearly.
This project highlights how data science can be used to understand patterns in education, leveraging powerful Python tools for a detailed analysis of key performance indicators.
